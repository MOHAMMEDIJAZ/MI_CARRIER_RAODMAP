# Roadmap to Embedded Engineering

This repository should serve as a guide to anyone who wants to study software and hardware for embedded systems but doesn't know where to start.

## Motivation

Maybe some undergratuate students who wants to study and work with embedded systems have found some difficulty to know what to study. Many are used to work with Arduino, which is a good start, but when it comes to make prototypes and projects more like real world projects, making hardware and software more professional, it's hard to know the best way to do it.

I notice the problem when I started to look for internships and Jr. jobs. The companies are always asking for knowledge that the university doesn't teach usually. Of course, if you are a Computer Engineering student or some course related, you'll have a strong base to work   in this area. But this isn't enough.

To work serious with embedded systems, some preparation is necessary, in order to achieve the knowledge needed to work with both universes: **software and hardware**.

> **Nota para quem não fala inglês:** Um dos principais requisitos exigidos na maioria dos cargos oferecidos na área é um conhecimento em inglês suficientemente bom para falar e escrever, no mínimo. Por este motivo o repositório e tudo que for escrito será em inglês, não só para incentivar a leitura e aumentar o alcance dos temas abordados, mas também para que eu mesmo pratique a escrita dia após dia.

> **Note to non english speakers:** One of the main requisites that are required in jobs and internships is english. At least you need to speak and write. That's the reason this repository is being written in english, not only to increase reach, but for me either to train english everyday.

## Goals

The main goal here is to study most of the things needed to work with embedded engineering. With a lot of research I've done a collection of subjects that we need to know. Based on what professionals in the field says and what internships and junior jobs asks, we'll study the main topics in order to be prepared.

### How will this works

We are going to explore two main subjects: **software** and **hardware**. This repository structure will be divided in directories, which every one will have their own *README* with links to access **courses, indications of books, articles and examples of the exercises** that I'll do and document.

This repository should be updated a lot, in order to give you the best way to learn all of the subjects that will be learned.

### Some study subjects

## General Content

Here I'll put some content that are useful, not only for studying but also implementing and practicing in real life projects.

### README

>👁‍🗨 Good documentation can be the key to your project's success.

| Title | Access Link | Platform | Type | Tier | Difficulty | Summary
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Writing READMEs | [Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777) | Free | Course | Beginner | Udacity | Documentation is an important part of the development process. Learn to write READMEs using Markdown so your code can be used by other humans! (Text from course)

### Version Control - Git

>👁‍🗨 The versioning system in the development world is a necessary knowledge in practically 100% of the serious projects you are likely to work on. Whether in professional or personal projects, having a solid foundation in this is essential to ensure a good workflow, as well as being an ally of documentation.

| Title | Access Link | Platform | Type | Tier | Difficulty | Summary

| Introduction to Git | [Link](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) | Free | Lecture¹ | Beginner | YouTube/Notes | Why is version control useful? Even when you’re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more. When working with others, it’s an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed, as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development. (Text from lecture notes)

>[¹] Lecture notes have a lot of usefil links that you can use to learn more about the tool and see more advanced content.

You can practice using any tools that you have (Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, STM Cube, PlatformIO), learning what you need to build your first applications with RTOS.

>[1] It's a beginner course, but probably it's good if you already have knowledge on Arduino and/or boards like ESP32 development.

### Qt: for embedded GUI applications

>👁‍🗨 Often you can find job offers with Qt applications on embedded devices. It's a C++ framework that can run anywhere (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, IOS, Raspberry, etc) and have more than 25 years of development and presence on the market.

>❕ Bryan Cairns is one of the best Qt teachers. He also have a lot of great paid courses on Udemy, but I'll not put them here, becase they are easy to find. If you want his paid courses for free, you can access the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1400884323467285) that he created to exchange knowledge about programming. Very often he gives several Cupom Codes for people who wants to learn from his courses for free.

>[1] It's a beginner course, but since this is a C++ Framework, it is recommended that you learn basics of C++ before.

### Cmake

>👁‍🗨 CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
